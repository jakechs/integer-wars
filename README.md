# Integer Wars

An educational game based on the classic game war! Red hearts and diamonds are negative, black clubs and spades are positive. 
Choose the card that represents the larger value and learn some important skills about negative integers along the way.

This is a *very* early version of this game. Thanks for checking it out, enjoy and hang tight while we add more features and fix more bugs. 

### Known Issues:
* To restart the game you must refresh the browser
* If a war ends in a war the game gets stuck
* If the last hand is a war the game will get stuck
* The indicator for the larger card is confusing. Working on a number line implementation to make this clearer.
